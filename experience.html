                    I'm Kat, a stay-at-home mom with a rich blend of experience in the people space and construction.
                    With a degree in Behavioral Science and over two decades of hands-on experience, I'm not your
                    typical mom; I'm someone who has seen the world from multiple angles: as a mother of six, a
                    grandmother to nine, and a professional in two vastly different fields.

                    My journey started in the bustling world of construction, where I worked my way up, managing
                    projects, coordinating teams, and navigating the often chaotic, male-dominated industry. But it
                    wasn’t just about hammers and blueprints for me—it was about understanding the dynamics of people. I
                    quickly learned that communication, empathy, and conflict resolution were as important as technical
                    knowledge. This understanding of human behavior became a cornerstone of my career. I didn’t just
                    build homes; I built relationships, fostering trust and cooperation among the diverse people I
                    worked with.

                    Despite my success in construction, My heart was always at home. I had a deep desire to raise my
                    children, each with their own unique personality and needs. I knew that the skills I had honed in
                    the workplace—active listening, problem-solving, and managing different personalities—would serve me
                    well in motherhood. As a mom, I embraced the challenges and joys that came with raising a large
                    family. From managing homework to navigating the emotional ups and downs of adolescence, I had
                    learned to be a multitasker like no other.

                    My background in Behavioral Science gave me a unique edge when it came to understanding my children.
                    I learned when to step in and when to give them space, when to praise and when to redirect. My
                    ability to identify and address emotional and behavioral needs became a valuable asset. I can read a
                    room full of kids like no one else could, picking up on subtle cues that others might miss.

                    And now, as a grandmother to seven, almost nine, I have found myself in yet another role that blends
                    my skills. I'm not just the fun, loving grandma—I'm also a mentor and guide. I find joy in watching
                    my grandchildren grow and helping them navigate their own lives, always using my behavioral science
                    background to offer advice on everything from handling emotions to building self-confidence. Whether
                    I'm babysitting or hosting family gatherings, I'm often the glue that holds the family together, a
                    source of wisdom and comfort for the next generation.

                    Despite my years of experience, my life hasn’t been without its challenges. Balancing six kids and
                    later, nine grandchildren, often felt overwhelming, but it’s these very experiences that have shaped
                    me into the compassionate and resourceful woman I am today. My home is often a haven of activity,
                    but I wouldn't have it any other way.

                    Through it all, I remained a stay-at-home mom, not because I'm stuck or unwilling to work, but
                    because I have created a fulfilling and meaningful role for myself. With my skills in understanding
                    people and navigating complex environments, I have found purpose in my role as a caretaker,
                    educator, and guide. For me, it’s not about the title—it’s about the impact I make every day. I am
                    proof that the heart of a home isn’t just in the walls, but in the strength, wisdom, and love of the
                    person who nurtures it.
