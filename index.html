            I am a fun-loving, somewhat introverted mom of six great kids. I have nine grandkids who keep me
            busy and I
            love it all!

        </p>
        <p>
            After completing my degree, I found myself at home taking care of our youngest kids. I decided to get
            into cooking and making the perfect loaf of sourdough. I ran an art studio for several years and
            recently decided to get back out there in the workforce. I've been learning basic coding and hope to
            make a career pivot into tech soon.

                I have done work in several sectors, home construction, fine art, call centers, as well as project
                managment.
                I've dabbled in all sorts of things and consider myself well-rounded. I'm looking to make an entry into
                the
                data
                world now that my youngest son is ten, and I have more time on my hands.
